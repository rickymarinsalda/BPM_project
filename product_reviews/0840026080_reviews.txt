Needed this for school. The bookstore was selling them for $70. This was much cheaper. Works just fine. Minus 1 star because it came with a partially drained battery, but it was used, so that is expected.	4.0
I had to buy this responsecard xr for a few of my large classes that required it to take attendance, it works perfectly and have not had any problems with it.	5.0
The product has been working great, and really appreciate the fast shipping. Only thing was that the product came in without working batteries. So hence as a customer I wasn't  completely satisfied, but all in all great product.	4.0
I ordered a turningpoint response card and got it on time. The sender sent me an e-mail explaining why he had to ship it late, everything was convenient. Good job!	5.0
I got it for 4.99$ plus 5$ shipping(not sure if it was intentional). Works as intended.
there is no point in buying a new one when you can buy used one.	5.0
