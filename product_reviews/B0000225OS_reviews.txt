This bit has lasted twice as long as previous masonry bits and it's still in good shape. I recommend them.	5.0
Dull in under 10 minutes. I just needed it to drill a couple of holes into the concrete slap under my house. Got one hole.	2.0
i was dissaponited in that i htought they were 6 inch drill bits instead 3 or 4 inch  bite because  i needed a little longer bit	3.0
It's just a drill bit.  Nothing fancy but it works.  Just make sure you are using a hammer drill and not a regular drill if you want to actually go through any masonry.  Recommended.	5.0
Used it to install a sliding shower/tub door. DON'T use it to drill the holes in the door rails.  It's not meant for that (yeah, I found out the hard way after I noticed the holes weren't circular)-:
Works great drilling through ceramic tile and durock though.  Very smooth cut...went through like butter.	5.0
worked as expected	5.0

Did not work well after drilling through the first item (bottom of a pot) it very quickly went dull, and I know it was a kind of pot a masonry bit should have gotten through because a friend's drill did the job just fine.	2.0
I got four holes drilled in mortar before the bit gave out (didn't break, just got so dull that it would no longer cut).

Thankfully, I only needed five and I could hammer my way through the last half of the last one.	2.0
Dont use if you need it for your job. Constant use filed the tip to a dull flat nub	1.0
Nice drill bit	5.0
Purchased to secure a safe to a concrete floor. The bit worked well for the first two holes but snapped in half on the third hole.  One more bit should finish the job.	3.0
