Excellent value!  Staples are excellent quality.  Not a single misfire and they are coated in addition to the galvanizing.  Price is great.  Each box was in an outer box, then the box was packed in a large box with cushioning material.	5.0
I bought these as a DIY'r who didn't want to by the  4K offered by the Big Box Stores.  They worked and didnot jam... recommend them if you have a situation like mine.	4.0
Thousands and Thousands shot through a Porter Cable and Milwaukee with no problem. Previously we used Senco staples (made in USA) but the cost got out of hand. We reluctantly switched to the B & C and glad we did. Top quality.	5.0
I have fired 10's of thousands of B & C Eagle staples through my PC narrow crown staple gun with no problems; including 1/2", 5/8", 3/4", and 1". I will continue using them.	5.0

I used these in a Harbor Freight pneumatic stapler to install 5/16 chip board to 3/4 plywood sub floor. Not one misfire or jam. I highly recommend these.	5.0
