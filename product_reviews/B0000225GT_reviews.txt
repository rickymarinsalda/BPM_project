These 18 ga nails are not of the size necessary for the 16 ga Porter-Cable Finish  Nailer that they are typically advertised with (FN250A).  They sometimes  came out 2 at a time, not at all, or caused the nailer to jam.  I called  Porter-Cable, and acquired the correct size nails, and the problems went away. I would  not recommend these 18 ga nails, especially for this 16ga nailer.	1.0

I purchased these brads along with a Porter Cable Nailer.  The width of the heads are 10% less wide than the Porter Cable brads that I purchased at Home Depot for a cheaper price!  The Porter Cable items have a better holding surface too.	1.0
Hey, they're nails, OK.  Not complicated.  I use them in a Porter Cable BN-200 and they work well.	4.0
Excellent is every respect.

I have used these nails extensively in my Bostich BT-50 (on my 3rd box of 5000) with no problem at all. Possibly other manufacturers have lower tolerances or are not up to par with the Bostich, but the nails work just great.....	5.0
This is about the most common brad size I use in my shop.  These are fairly soft, so deflection can be a problem if you are not careful about the material you are nailing.  Avoid knots and obtuse angles on plywood.  They hold well and can be difficult to remove once driven.	3.0
